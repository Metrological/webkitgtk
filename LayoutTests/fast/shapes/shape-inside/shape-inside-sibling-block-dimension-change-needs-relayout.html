<div class="content">
    <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
    bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
    book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
    it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
    conversation?'</p>

    <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
    hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
    of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
    picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
    close by her.</p>
</div>
<p>
A triangle shape is defined through the left-top, right-top, right-bottom points of the rectangle.
The content should respect the shape-inside polygon boundaries after we applied the padding.</p>
